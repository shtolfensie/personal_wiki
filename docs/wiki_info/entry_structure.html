<h1 id="entrystructure">Entry Structure</h1>
<p>Each entry should have a clear <strong>title</strong> created like this: <code># Title</code>.<br />
Depending on the length, the title should be followed by a short <strong>summary</strong> of the contents update after each edit.</p>
<p>If the entry is not the top most item in the group, it should <strong>link</strong> to its <strong>parent</strong> like so:<br />
<code>[↑ Back to: 'Parent entry title'](./parent.md)</code> =&gt; <a href="./parent.md">↑ Back to: 'Parent entry title'</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Note: This may be automated in the future by a way of a script used to update table of contents for the group and links to parents and then push to the repo</p>
  <p>Note: other possible arrow symbols: ← → ▲ ▼ ◀ ▶ ➔ ↰ ↱ ↲ ↴ ↳ ↵<br />
  will decide later</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each <em>larger</em>[^larger_fn] entry should contain a ToC generated through VScode extension or written manually.</p>
<pre><code>Table of contents
- [Group Structur](#group-structure)
- [test](#test)
  - [test](#test-1)
</code></pre>
<p>Footnotes are possible through a VScode extension. First a footnote in the actual text is needed. <code>Here is a footnote[^name_of_fn]</code> =&gt; Here is a footnote[^name<em>of</em>fn].<br />
Then the same tag needs to be placed somewhere in the text. Doesn't matter where, altough it is best if the footnote is written at the end of the file. =&gt; <code>[^name_of_fn]: Example footnote</code></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Actually I'm not sure if I want to have footnotes. Will decide later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[^larger_fn]: This is dependent solely on the authors decision, but it is recomended that every entry with more than 5 headings and/or more than 2 levels of headings should be considered _larger<em>.
[^name</em>of_fn]: Example footnote.</p>
